            \nThis is just a quick message to let you know that after a discussion with the other subreddit mods, the decision to demote you has unfortunately been taken. 
            \nI'll outline the reasons below:
            \n* It is still suspected that you are not the age you said upon application (35, which would be 36 now considering you applied in summer 2018) due to a number of factors: a) you stating different ages at different points (you said 34 on other occasions, most recently October 2019), b) your schedule and things such as having exams indicates you are still in school, c) generally just how you act (such as asking users we know to be young teenagers for advice/falling for scams I don't expect someone who is a grown adult to fall for). It has been noticed by others within the moderation team, and whilst it's possible that these are merely coincidental - I think there are too many factors for this to be the case, and I don't like the thought of having been lied to on the application. 
            \n* Secondly, you are unavailable a lot. I know moderating this server isn't taxing and is voluntary in people's free time, but I expect people to be available in the case of something going wrong. You constantly post about being unavailable in the #discord-moderation chat, mentioning weeks or a month+ of inactivity periods. It was fine at one point where it would be a day or two, but the constant weeks or months is too much.
            \nThanks for the work you did whilst a mod, and it's unfortunate that it came to this but it's been brewing for a while.`);

These include, but are not limited to:\nRudeness towards other Redditors,\nSpreading incorrect information,\nSarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.\nAm I banned from the Reddit?\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\nI don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\nHow can I prevent this from happening in the future?\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.`);
